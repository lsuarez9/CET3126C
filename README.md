## Course Overview
CET3126C introduces the study of **advanced microprocessor design** and computer architecture.  
The course emphasizes both theoretical concepts and practical applications through **hands-on labs using the Arduino Mega 2560**.  

Students will explore:
- Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and execution pipelines  
- CPU subsystems: datapaths, control, and hazards  
- Memory hierarchy and storage subsystems  
- Input/Output organization  
- Multiprocessors, concurrency, and benchmarking  
- Research practices in computer architecture  

---

## Course Competencies
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Explain the history, key terminology, and industry trends in computer architecture.  
2. Demonstrate how data is represented within a computer system and apply ISA fundamentals.  
3. Analyze the processor (CPU) subsystem, including pipelining and hazards.  
4. Understand the memory subsystem and hierarchy.  
5. Explain storage systems and I/O subsystems.  
6. Evaluate multiprocessor systems and benchmarking practices.  
7. Apply practical research skills in computer architecture.
